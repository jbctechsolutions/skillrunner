## Task Description
Prepare Skillrunner for v0.1.0 open-source beta launch with Homebrew integration.

The project is a Go-based local-first AI workflow orchestration tool. We need to:
1. Fix critical code issues (OpenCode backend stub, terminal spawner, chat provider registration, git branch check)
2. Integrate API key encryption properly
3. Add release infrastructure (goreleaser, GitHub Actions release workflow)
4. Create missing documentation (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md)
5. Update CI to Go 1.24 and add release automation
6. Integrate with homebrew tap at https://github.com/jbctechsolutions/homebrew-skillrunner
7. Update version from 0.1.0-dev to 0.1.0 with proper ldflags injection
